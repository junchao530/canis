# CANIS Data Visualization and Foreign Interference üåêüîç

Welcome to the CANIS Data Visualization and Foreign Interference repository! This project houses two state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools designed to revolutionize the way we interact with, analyze, and visualize data.

## The Silk Route üõ§Ô∏è

**The Silk Route** is an interactive data-driven web application that enables real-time automated visualizations. This tool empowers users to develop various analytics solutions through an intuitive interface, fostering innovation at every step.

### Features:

- **Interactive Frontend Interface**: Built with React.js, offering a responsive and dynamic user experience.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Integrates jVectorMap for seamless geographic data representation.
- **User-Driven Analysis**: Allows users to interact with the data to uncover hidden patterns and insights.

## Lida üß†

**Lida** represents the pinnacle of AI-driven data analysis platforms. By incorporating large language models, Lida transforms data files into interactive, query-based visual stories, providing deep insights in a model-agnostic fashion.

### Features:

- **Query-Based AI Visualizer**: Built in Python this leverages Microsoft's new open source Lida repository and Streamlit for a conversational data exploration experience.
- **Model Agnostic**: Ensures compatibility and flexibility across various machine learning models and frameworks. Can operate with HF models and locally ran models like Llama for added security if you don't wnat your data to hit OPENAI servers.
